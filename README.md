## Localization tool for Unity Developers
Built as a project for a Game Engine Development course, this localization tool allows game devs to create a dictionary of general phrase's and their corresponding words/sentences in a variety of languages. Using this dictionary of phrases, they have the ability to construct conversation trees used to prompt the player character.
