## Localization tool for Unity Developers
Built as a project for a Game Engine Development course, this localization tool allows game devs to create a dictionary of general phrases with corresponding words/sentences in a variety of languages. Using this dictionary of phrases, the dev has the ability to construct conversation trees used to prompt the player character.
